      <p class="org-description is-size-4">Maintaining fitness is one of the important taks for human being. Doing exercises and maintaining good health is the top priority for humans. The very known two terms to us are the word ‘health’ and ‘fitness’. Many times we tell or use these words whenever we say phrases like ‘health is wealth’ and ‘fitness is the key’. What does the word health really mean? It implies the idea of ‘being well’. A healthy and fit person is the one when he/she can function well physically as well as mentally. Proper health and fitness do not depend on our own but also on our physical environment and the quality of food intake. </p>
      <p class="org-description is-size-4">Health and fitness is the most important aspect of our life.  There is nothing more important than health for any human being.  When we are healthy and fit we are able to enjoy our life well. We can talk to our near and dear one, we can laugh, smile, travel, enjoy food, and sleep well.
But when our health and fitness is not up to the mark, we are unable to do anything properly and stay behind. We cannot enjoy eating, watching sports or movies.  Our mood always remains negative and we are unable to talk nicely with our near and dear or even sleep properly. Our health and fitness are more valued than our wealth.  In fact, our elders were always been focused on the health and fitness part. They treasure it like wealth. To maintain good health and fitness at its best all the time, we need to take care of hygiene and sanitation around us.</p>
